# Complex Python example: Voting eligibility

# Get user input for age
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Convert the user input to an integer
age = int(user_age)

# Check if the user is eligible to vote
if age >= 18:
    print("Congratulations! You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    years_until_eligible = 18 - age
    print(f"Sorry, you are not eligible to vote yet. You need to wait {years_until_eligible} years.")
