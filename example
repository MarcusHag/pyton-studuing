# Arithmetic operators
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division
print(x % y)  # Modulo
print(x ** y)  # Exponentiation
print(x // y)  # Floor division

# Comparison operators
print(x == y)  # Equal to
print(x != y)  # Not equal to
print(x > y)  # Greater than
print(x < y)  # Less than
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to

# Logical operators
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # Logical AND
print(a or b)  # Logical OR
print(not a)  # Logical NOT

# Bitwise operators
x = 10  # Binary 1010
y = 4  # Binary 0100
print(x & y)  # Bitwise AND
print(x | y)  # Bitwise OR
print(~x)  # Bitwise NOT
print(x ^ y)  # Bitwise XOR
print(x << 2)  # Bitwise left shift
print(x >> 2)  # Bitwise right shift

# Assignment operators
x = 5
x += 3  # Addition assignment
print(x)
x -= 3  # Subtraction assignment
print(x)
x *= 3  # Multiplication assignment
print(x)
x /= 3  # Division assignment
print(x)
x %= 3  # Modulo assignment
print(x)
x //= 3  # Floor division assignment
print(x)
x **= 3  # Exponentiation assignment
print(x)

# Identity operators
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x
print(x is z)  # Returns True because z is the same object as x
print(x is y)  # Returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content
print(x == y)  # Returns True because x and y have the same content

# Membership operators
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
print("apple" in fruits)  # Returns True because "apple" is in the fruits list
print("orange" not in fruits)  # Returns True because "orange" is not in the fruits list

// I have to realize how other operators work
